## Research Interests

I enjoy input-adaptive modeling on real-life scenarios. 
- <span class="highlight"><b><u>Multimodal (Video) Generation / Understanding</u></b></span>: self-correcting and adaptive architecture with RL/post-training
- <span class="highlight"><b><u>Physical AI</u></b></span>: adaptive action modeling in embodied scenario with <b>perceptual modality</b> (e.g., 3D LiRAR, Gaze, HD Maps).
